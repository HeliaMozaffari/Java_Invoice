Java Classes and Test
Invoice
(Invoice Class) Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to
represent an invoice for an item sold at the store. An Invoice should include four
pieces of information as instance variables—a part number (type String), a part
description (type String), a quantity of the item being purchased (type int) and a
price per item (double). Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four
instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. In
addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that calculates the invoice
amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns the amount as a
double value. If the quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per item is
not positive, it should be set to 0.0. Write a test application named InvoiceTest that
demonstrates class Invoice’s capabilities.

Dates
(Date Class) Create a class called Date that includes three instance variables—a
month (type int), a day (type int) and a year (type int). Provide a constructor that
initializes the three instance variables and assumes that the values provided are
correct. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. Provide a method
displayDate that displays the month, day and year separated by forward slashes (/).
Write a test application named DateTest that demonstrates class Date’s capabilities.
